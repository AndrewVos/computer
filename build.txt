# lego dimensions

- 8mm per square
- 18mm high

# raspberry pi dimensions

- 85mm x 56mm


# for a high build

50mm for usb port clearance?
= (85mm + 50mm) / 18mm
around 8 blocks high



minimum 8 * 11 blocks internal dimensions
minimum 11 squares internal height or width
this isn't taking into account the usb connections to the pi
should be 13 lego squares wide
